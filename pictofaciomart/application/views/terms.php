								<li class="mt-0 ">Users must be 18 years of age or older to register, or visit or use the Services in any manner.
By registering, visiting or using the Services, you hereby represent and warrant to Picto Facio Mart
that you are 18 years of age or older, and that you have the right, authority and capacity
to use the Services, and agree to abide by the Agreement. If a User is below 18 years of
age, it is assumed that he/she is using/browsing the Platforms under the supervision of
his/her parent or legal guardian and that such User’s parent or legal guardian has read
and agrees to the terms of this Agreement, including terms of purchase of Products, on
behalf of the minor User. Should Picto Facio Mart be made aware that a User is under the age of
18 and is using/browsing the Platforms without the supervision of his/her parent or legal
guardian, Picto Facio Mart reserves the right to deactivate such User’s account without further
notice. </li>

								 <li>The contents of Services, information, text, graphics,
images, logos, button icons, software code, interface, design and the collection, arrangement
and assembly of the content on the Platforms or any of the other Services are the property
of Picto Facio Mart, its parent company, group companies, subsidiaries, associates, affiliates,
suppliers, vendors and sister companies, as the case may be (“Picto Facio Mart Content”), and
are protected under copyright, trademark and other applicable laws. You shall not modify
the Picto Facio Mart Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform, distribute, reverse engineer
or otherwise use the Picto Facio Mart Content in any way for any public or commercial purpose
or for personal gain. </li>
<li>As means to assist the Users in
identifying the Products of their choice, Picto Facio Mart provides visual representations on the
Platforms including graphics, illustrations, photographs, images, videos, charts, screenshots,
infographics and other visual aids. While reasonable efforts are made to provide accurate
visual representations, Picto Facio Mart disclaims any guarantee or warranty of exactness of
such visual representation or description of the Product, with the actual Product ultimately
delivered to Users. The appearance of the Product when delivered may vary for various
reasons. </li>
<li>Users may make purchases on the Platforms. For the
purposes of identifying a User, Picto Facio Mart may, from time to time, collect certain personally
identifiable information such as your first name and last name, email address, mobile phone
number, postal address, other contact information, demographic profile, etc. Users may also
register themselves on the Platforms. Registration on the Platforms is one-time and you are
required to remember your username and password and keep the same confidential. In the
event where you have misplaced your username and password details, you can retrieve and
change the same using the “forgot username/password” option on the Platforms.</li>
<li>The User shall assume all risks, liabilities, and consequences if his/her account has been
accessed illegally or without authorisation through means such as hacking and if through
such unauthorised access, a purchase of Products has been made through the Services. It
is specifically clarified that payments of monies towards any Products purchased through
the Services by unauthorised or illegal use of the User’s account shall entirely be borne by the
User.</li>
<li>Display of Products for purchase on the Platforms is merely an invitation to offer. An
order placed by a User for purchase of a Product constitutes an offer. All orders placed by
Users on the Platforms are subject to the availability of such Product, Picto Facio Marts acceptance
of the User’s offer and the User’s continued adherence to the terms of the Agreement.</li>
<li>You agree to maintain and promptly update all data provided by you and to keep it true,
accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not
current, incomplete, or if Picto Facio Mart has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information
provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current, incomplete, or not in accordance with the
terms of the Agreement, Picto Facio Mart reserves the right to indefinitely suspend, terminate or
block your access to the Platforms, and refuse to provide you with access to the Platforms in future</li>
<li>All rights and liabilities of Picto Facio Mart with respect to any Services to be provided by it
shall be restricted to the scope of the Agreement. In addition to the Agreement, you shall also
ensure that you are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the third parties, whose
links are contained/embedded in the Services. It is hereby clarified that Picto Facio Mart shall not be
held liable for any transaction between you and any such third parties.</li>
<li>You understand that on your registration as a User or on your purchase of Products
on the Platforms, you may receive text messages (including through internet-based mobile
messaging) and/or emails from Picto Facio Mart on your registered mobile number and/or
email address. These messages and/or emails could relate inter alia to your registration,
Picto Facio Mart’s acceptance or rejection of your offer to purchase a Product, payment information,
Product despatch information, information pertaining to other activities you carry out on the
Platforms and information pertaining to the promotions that are undertaken by Picto Facio Mart
(or third parties in connection with the Platforms) from time to time. It is specifically clarified
that a text message and/or an email confirming the receipt of your order is not an acceptance
from Picto Facio Mart that the Product will be delivered. Picto Facio Mart’s acceptance to your offer
to purchase shall occur and conclude only when the Products have been despatched by
Picto Facio Mart and a text message and/or email confirming such despatch has been sent to you.
Picto Facio Mart, at all times, reserves the right to limit the quantity of items in, or cancel an order
prior to despatch.</li>
<li>Any communication from Picto Facio Mart shall be sent only to your registered mobile number
and/or email address or such other contact number or email address that you may designate,
for any particular transaction. You shall be solely responsible to update your registered
mobile number and/or email address on the Platforms in the event there is a change. Further,
Picto Facio Mart may also send you notifications and reminders with respect to scheduled deliveries
of the purchased Products. While Picto Facio Mart shall make every endeavour to share prompt
reminders and notifications relating to the delivery of purchased Products with you, Picto Facio Mart
shall not be held liable for any failure to send such notifications or reminders to you.</li>
<li>
Picto Facio Mart may, at any time and without having to service any prior notice to you:<br>
(i) upgrade, update, change, modify, or improve the Services or a part of the Services in a
manner it may deem fit, and <br>
(ii) change the contents of the Agreement in substance, or as to
procedure or otherwise; in each case which will be applicable to all Users. You hereby agree
that this is in the fairness of things given the nature of the business and its operations and
you will abide by them. As such, you must keep yourself updated at all times and review the
terms of the Agreement from time to time. Such changes shall be made applicable when
they are posted. Picto Facio Mart may also alter or remove any content from the Platforms without
notice.</li>
<li>While Picto Facio Mart shall make reasonable endeavours to maintain high standards of
security and shall provide the Services by using reasonable efforts, Picto Facio Mart shall not be
liable for any interruption that may be caused to your access or use of the Services.</li>
<li>Access to and registration on the Platforms is free of cost. Although unlikely, Picto Facio Mart
may modify the Fee, Payment and Promotions Policy to include a fee on access and browsing
of the Platforms, or for use of any new service introduced by Picto Facio Mart without serving prior
notice on the Users.</li>
